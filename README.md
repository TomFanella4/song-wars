# Song Wars

## UI Usability:
- Required Resources:
- Modern Updated Browser
- Spotify Desktop App
- Website URL: http://songwars-frontend.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com

## Visual Guide:

### / and /bracket

![song1](https://github.com/TomFanella4/song-wars/blob/master/images/song1.png)

- Each of the elements should be styled like the above screenshot
- The bracket should show the results of the votes the day after all of the vote have been counted
- On the final day the winner of the bracket should be displayed in the center of the bracket
- There should be a preview displayed on the bottom for each of the matches
- The Vote button should launch the Vote view
- The play button places the song in the player widget located at the bottom bar
- The Day counter should start at 1
- As the Day counter progresses, the song elements corresponding to each day should progress through the bracket as well

### /search

![song2](https://github.com/TomFanella4/song-wars/blob/master/images/song2.png)

- Typing in the search box should instantly search
- Search results should be in sorted order
- Search results should display the name, album, artist, album art, and popularity classification
- Search results should contain a Play and Recommend button
- The play button places the song in the player widget
- The recommend button recommends the song for next week's bracket
- When no results are found a message should be displayed
- We assume users will recommend enough songs to complete the requirements of filling a full bracket.

### /statistics

![song3](https://github.com/TomFanella4/song-wars/blob/master/images/song3.png)

- The statistics page should display statistics about the application to the user
- The statistics page will update on a timed schedule
- If a user wants to manually update the statistics page (see: /admin/stats/update - POST)

### /about

![song4](https://github.com/TomFanella4/song-wars/blob/master/images/song4.png)

- The about page should display some information about the application

### /{unmatched}

![song5](https://github.com/TomFanella4/song-wars/blob/master/images/song5.png)

- A 404 Page should be shown for any route that is not defined in the application

## Cross-site abilities

- The Login button should redirect to the spotify login page and store the user’s data in the browser
- The Logout button should redirect to the homepage and remove the user’s data from the browser
- When a play button is in the player, click the play button in the lower left hand corner to play the song (you must have the Spotify Desktop app installed)
- Clicking any of the links in the sidebar should link to that page
- Clicking the menu bar in the top left corner should toggle the sidebar
- The default song should be either the song the user is currently listening to or the most recent winner

### /admin/migrate/brackets - POST

Intent:

In production, this endpoint wouldn’t exist, and the code would run in a timed manner, once per week, on Monday at midnight, however for testing purposes we open this to you. The purpose of this is to move on from last week’s bracket and start a new bracket from the recommendations taken from the last week. This also updates in stats the number of recommendations for the new bracket. The sequence of events here is to take top recommendations for songs below or equal to a popularity of 70, and grab the next top 10 with unrestricted popularity rating and fill the last_week_bracket table at round one. Songs in each side of the bracket are shuffled (still no cross-pollination however). Afterward, last_week_bracket, users_last_week_bracket, users_recommendations, and recommendations tables are emptied. 

Expected Input:

    Empty

Expected Output:

    Empty

### /admin/migrate/round - POST

Intent:

In production, this endpoint wouldn’t exist, and the code would run in a timed manner, once on Tuesday midnight, Wednesday midnight, Thursday midnight, and Friday midnight, however for testing purposes we open this to you. The purpose of this is to move the winners of the last round, to the next round, increasing the round by one.

Expected Input:

    Empty

Expected Output:

    Empty

### /admin/stats/update - POST

Intent:

Updates all statistics into stats table, so that updated statistics will be returned by /stats - GET. Updates everything but the number of recommendations, which is done when brackets are migrated. In production, this endpoint wouldn’t exist, and the code would run in a timed manner.

Expected Input:

    None

Expected Output:

    None
